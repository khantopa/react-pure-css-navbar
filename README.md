# Coding Project

Congratulations on reaching to this stage. This means that you have reached one of the last stage of the interview process.

Completing this project will help us better assess your current experience level.

This project should not take you more than 2 hours to complete.

# Requirements

See below for the requirements.

## TODO

1. Convert the main navigation meny (Home, About, Media, Contact Us) to a mobile responsive component.
2. On desktop view: The main navigation menu should be horizontally aligned right and padded nicely
3. On mobile view:

- The main navigation menu should be hidden
- The main navigation menu is replaced by the "hamburger" (/src/assets/img/icons8-menu-24.png) menu
- On clicking the "hamburger" menu, the main navigation menu should appear as a drop-down menu
- The drop-down menu should be vertically aligned

## Some points to consider

- Create this as a reusable component(s)
- Main navigation menu and drop-down menu should not be repeated (i.e; should not have 2 separate versions for mobile and desktop)
- Do not worry about beautifying it, as long as it meets the requirements above
- Redux or any other state management is not required. Just using simple react state should suffice.
